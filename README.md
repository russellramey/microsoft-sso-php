## Description
Microsoft Graph single sign on (SSO) script, written in PHP. This is a very basic script to authenticate a user is part of the Microsoft365 service. Simplest way to use is to make sure a user is part of your domain by restricting access to the app/site if their email is not of the correct domain.
